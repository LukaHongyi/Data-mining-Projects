dataprocess.py includes data separation, such as extracting the desired binary problem dataset from the entire dataset. 
dataprocess.py also includes the separation of train and test data as well as the 5-folder data separation.
dataprocess.py also includes each dimension reduction methods. Use the methods names as function names.

Each xxx(model).py is named by their model name. They are used to tune 5-fold cross-validation.
Each xxxvali(model).py is name by their model name. They are used to do the final validation (with tuned hyperparameters).

Each xxx(methods).py is named by their dimension reduction methods name. They are used to call methods in dataprocess.py on different models.

letter-recognition.data is the original dataset.
BOdata.data, HKdata.data, MYdata.data are binary classification problems' datasets. They are generated by dataprocess.py.
